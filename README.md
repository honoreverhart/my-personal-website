# my-personal-website

This website contains three different pages (html files): Home, About Me, and Portfolio

Home:
This will include my mission statment, a picture of me, and a quote that I really like

Abbout Me:
This page is about hobbies I enjoy outside of working. Some include Crossfit, Singing, Puzzles, being Outdoors, etc.

Portfolio:
This will hold projects that I've worked on. I do not have any at the moment

Future changes:
I want to continue to make my website more unique by playing around with CSS and even Javascript. 
I want to master working with border, padding, and margins.
