    <h2>Crossfit</h2>
    <p>I've been doing Crossfit for about three years. I've done the official Crossfit Open twice and have competed in
        several local competitions. Crossfit has helped me grow physically, mentally, and spiritually. It has taught me
        endurance, perseverance, didscipline, and consistency in every part of my life! </p>

    <h2>Outdoors</h2>
    <p>I love to be outdoors! My favorite places are the mountains or beaches. Since I live in Colorado, the Rocky
        Mountains is my backyard! I love the mountains in fall when I can see all the pretty colors. Aspen trees are my
        favorite. I also love the ocean! Hawaii, though I've only visited once, forever has a piece of my heart! </p>

    <h2>Music</h2>
    <p>I love any and all music! I sing and play guitar, piano, ukulele, and any other instrument I can get my hands on.
        I'm a self-taught musician and even write my own songs! </p>

    <h2>Puzzles</h2>
    <p>I am always up for a puzzle! The best days are the rainy or snowy days when I can get some hot tea or coffee,
        listen to an audiobook or watch Gilmore Girls and do my puzzle!</p>
